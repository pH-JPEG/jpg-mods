# jpg-mods
 A series of mods I have created for the game Deep Rock Galactic.

- [**Nukeballers**](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-mods/tree/main/Nukeballers)
  - Spitballers, but they shoot Fat Boy projectiles now that leave behind a radiation field. The direct and AoE damage of the projectiles in the Standard and U versions are equivalent to the normal direct and AoE damage of a Spitballer projectile.
  - [Standard](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-mods/blob/main/Nukeballers/Nukeballers.pak): Spitballers fire a three-shot burst of Fat Boy projectiles.
  - [EX](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-mods/blob/main/Nukeballers/NukeballersEX.pak): Spitballers fire a continuous barrage of slow-moving Fat Boy projectiles that deal zero direct and AoE damage. However, the radiation clouds remain.
  - [U](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-mods/blob/main/Nukeballers/NukeballersU.pak): Spitballers fire a ten-shot burst of Fat Boy projectiles. The rate of fire of the projectiles is faster than in the Standard version.
